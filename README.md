🍩 Go Nuts, Donuts – Donut Catcher Game
Overview

Go Nuts, Donuts – Donut Catcher is a promotional web game built for the Go Nuts, Donuts dessert cart business based in Toronto, Canada.

The game is designed for live events, pop-ups, and online promotions where players catch falling donuts within a limited time.
Top scorers can win discount coupons or free donuts, verified by the vendor.

This project was designed, built, and deployed by me, and is hosted publicly on AWS Amplify.
